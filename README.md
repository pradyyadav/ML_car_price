# ML_car_price
## In this project, the price of a car is predicted when buying it second hand.
The model used for prediction is random forest with accuracy of 93.2%.
Models like linear regression, SVM, decision tree, gradient boosting were also trained but had low accuracy than random forest
## The following files are in this repo :
### CAR_PRICE_PREDICTION.ipynb 
Jupyter notebook of the project
### Data_Test.xlsx
Excel file of variables on which model predicts the output(price)
### Price.xlsx
Output price of the tested values
